1. For the BACKEND:
    - make sure that python and pgadmin is installed on the local machine (python 3.12.4)
    - install the following modules:
        - django
        - djangorestframework
        - django-cors-headers (managing the request coming from different domains)
        - psycopg2 (database adapror)
    - create your database for the app using PostgreSQL
    - add details in the settings.py (NAME, USER, PASSWORD, HOST, PORT)
    - make the migrations
    - run backend using "python manage.py runserver"

2. For the FRONTEND:
    - make sure node is installed on the local machine (node 14.17.3)
    - run "npm install" to install the dependencies
    - this application uses AXIOS for making the HTTP requests. In axiosConfig/axiosInstance.js set the base URL (host:port)
    - run frontend by using "npm start"
